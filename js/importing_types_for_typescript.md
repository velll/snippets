title: "Importing types for packages"
---
Some packages provide built-in type declarations. Some of those that do not still have types under `@types` organization (aka [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)).

E.g. `lodash`:
```bash
npm install --save @types/lodash
```
